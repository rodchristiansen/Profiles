# Profiles

In my struggles to understand and deploy profiles in the past few months led me to create a master template that is clear to understand and reproducible for many different system and application settings.

Containing commentary on each section this is a great way for first timers in the world of management profiles.

The MasterProfileTemplate.mobileconfig can be deployed as is by simply replacing the indicated relevant areas to what your profile is to accomplish. Save it as a .mobileconfig and deploy it. Keep the comments in place if you’d like, it works perfectly fine with them included in my testing.

This is a more manual process than the very intelligently created [MCXtoProfile](https://github.com/timsutton/mcxToProfile), which is what you’ll likely need if targeting MCX settings for your .mobileconfig. This master template can be works well for .plists you have access to read and copy the keys on your environment.
