# MasterProfileTemplate.mobileconfig

In my struggles to understand and deploy profiles in the past few months led me to create a master template that is clear to understand and reproducible for many different system and application settings.

Containing commentary on each section this is a great way for first timers in the world of management profiles.

The MasterProfileTemplate.mobileconfig can be deployed as is by simply replacing the indicated relevant areas to what your profile is to accomplish. Save it as a .mobileconfig and deploy it. Keep the comments in place if youâ€™d like, it works perfectly fine with them included.

All of our profiles come from this master standard template. It's an artisanal process that we will probably automate more in the future.

I'll point you to the excellent ProfileCreator as an option: https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileCreator
